My life could have been vastly different in a number of ways if a few small moments or decisions in my life had gone differently.  Had one small number on a medical exam been slightly lower, I may not have had to deal with going to school alone in a faraway, unfamiliar city.  Had I allowed myself to pursue my enjoyment of writing and the theater, I might never have ended up turning wrenches in a sweltering shop behind a car dealership.  Had I never picked up those wrenches, I might never have found the joy in driving a manual transmission car down a curvy road at well above a sensible speed.

Lately, though, my life could be described as aimless.  I've drifted from job to job, trying to find something that could reignite my interest in learning, rather than just keeping my gas tank full.  To that end, I had a conversation with my cousin that gave me a lead.  I remember visiting him a few years ago in New York when he worked at what seemed like a dream job he landed right out of college, but turned out to be a huge drain on his well-being.  We walked through Central Park and he told me about a new passion project he had picked up.  He spent a long time going into detail about how excited he was about teaching himself how to code and how he was starting to think that he had found his new direction in life.  Fast-forward to a few months ago, and he had finished the Flatiron program, found a new job as a software engineer in Denver, and generally couldn't be happier.

As he told me about what he did and his decision to break into the software engineering field, I started to notice the parallels between fixing code and fixing cars.  Few things are as gratifying as working for hours on end to find some obscure fault or struggle through a tough repair, and to come out the other side with the engine running or the tests passing.  I began to think that software engineering could end up combining the problem solving and gratifying jobs I liked about working on cars with a generally better working environment.

So, this has become my new spark for learning and my new direction in my drifting through life.  I'm hopeful this will help me finally settle in to something I'll truly enjoy for a long time to come.
