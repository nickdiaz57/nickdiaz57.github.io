Just before the CLI Portfolio project started, I was a bit behind in where I should have been in the coursework.  Still, I attended a Zoom meeting to do a quick review of the requirements for the project.  At the time, I was convinced that I was hopelessly out of my depth.  I had maybe heard the term CLI once or twice before - how was I expected now to actually build one?

As I made my way through the material I needed to catch up, I often ended up retreating back into my current favorite timesink (and subject of my project) when I was feeling mentally drained:  Elite Dangerous.  From the outside the game looked almost impenetrable - nearly forty completely customizeable ships to play in, complex power dynamics and struggles between in-game NPC and player factions, literally millions of fully-rendered star systems to visit, and the unforgiving void of space always just outside your cockpit glass.  With time, though, I found that all I had to do was take things slowly.  Learn to fly in the starting ship.  Accept a mission to move some data or a couple tons of stuff to the next system over.  Fly there, get paid, rinse and repeat.  Buy a new ship, now I can move more stuff.  Buy another ship, now I can shoot rocks and make money doing it.  Buy another ship, now I can start shooting at other ships.  Buy another ship, and now I'm ready to leave everything behind and venture into the far reaches of the galaxy.  And I could get there all just by scraping the surface of what the galaxy had to offer.

The project ended up being much the same.  Watch a couple videos and remind myself what Nokogiri is and how to use it.  Use it to pick a couple websites and scrape a small amount of data about the ships and engineers of Elite off of them.  Use those bits of data to make a Ruby object out of each ship and each engineer.  Build some methods to make those objects tell users about themselves or to relate them to each other
